        st.markdown("A women's shelter is a safe house for women who are experiencing or at risk of violence. Women with or without children (boys up to 18 years old) can stay in a women's shelter. They receive temporary accommodation, protection, counseling, and support.")
        st.markdown("Each women's shelter has rules, including keeping the address confidential. This means, for example, that residents cannot receive visitors.")
        st.markdown("At the shelter, you will live with other women and children on the same floor, sharing spaces like the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and garden. Women without children often share a room with other women. Mothers and their children usually receive their own room. You should be able to organize your daily life independently.")
